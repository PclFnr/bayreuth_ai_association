The meetings are generally held every two weeks on Tuesday evenings, at 18:00 (exact starting time is 18:15) in room S 110. The exact dates are in our [Important dates](https://www.ai-association.uni-bayreuth.de/en/dates/index.html) page.

The first 15-20 minutes of every meeting will be spent discussing recent news happening on the fields of AI, machine learning and computer science. Then the schedule will depend on the type of meeting.

Our meetings have two flavours: AI-nstruction (technical, workshop or presentation-based approach) and AI-ntellectuals (non-technical, a more discussion-based approach). The aim of the AI-nstruction meetings is to share experience-based knowledge and resources to other students who are interested in applying AI and machine learning in their own research or personal projects. On the other hand, the goal of the AI-ntellectuals meetings is to promote interdisciplinary discussion and exchange ideas.

AI-nstruction meetings are focused on a topic, which could be an AI tool, a machine learning algorithm/paradigm or a specific resource of value for people interested in working with AI and machine learning. These meetings are usually led by a knowledge ambassador, a person with applied research experience on the topic. In this meetings, participants should have some knowledge of computer science and programming (mainly in machine learning with Python) to be able to follow and make the most of the meeting.

AI-ntellectuals meetings are semi-structured open discussions for anyone interested in AI topics. Depending on the number of participants and their interests, we might split into groups around different topics in AI, such as Ethics, Biases, Explainability, Social Impact, etc. Participants from any field and degree are very welcome, the more diverse the better!

In the future, new flavours of meetings and events will be included as well. For more information on our next meetings, please see our events calendar.
