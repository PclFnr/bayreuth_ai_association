The Bayreuth AI Association is an association of students enthusiastic about artificial intelligence. We want to promote the exchange on the topic of artificial intelligence with a focus on the practical implementation of algorithms.
Our mission is to create a space for the open exchange of ideas and experiences in the hands-on use of AI algorithms in and around Bayreuth.

Everyone is welcome to join us – from 1st semester to professor.

Our meetings are organized by topic and start with a short information about the topic before we share our experiences about it and learn from each other. In small projects we want to implement our ideas together.

We meet every second Tuesday from 18:00 – 20:00 in room S65, building RW I. For the exact dates, check out the [Important dates](https://www.ai-association.uni-bayreuth.de/en/dates/index.html) section.

For those attending, feel free to join our open WhatsApp group were we send updates and share relvant AI news and info: [Link to join](https://chat.whatsapp.com/CYZelJF7rDYFkEuz94n86j)

Please feel free to contact us if you are interested!
